## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Kopi Paras is designed like:

> A film.  
> A ritual.  
> A slow pour.  

Every section transitions like a scene.  
Every animation feels intentional.  
Every scroll reveals narrative.

This project explores **scrollytelling as brand storytelling**.

## 🧩 Key Concept

The homepage is structured in two storytelling layers:

1. Full cinematic hero scroll sequence  
2. Gradient narrative content sections  

Powered by:

- Framer Motion scroll progress
- Lenis smooth interpolation
- Custom noise overlays
- Dark coffee-inspired theme
